# Collaborative Learning Across Devices

Train AI models across multiple devices without sharing your data.

## What Is Federated Learning?

Imagine you have 10 robots in different warehouses. Each robot learns from its local environment, but you want them all to benefit from each other's experience **without sending sensitive data to the cloud**.

That's federated learning: devices learn together while keeping data private.

---

## What You Can Do

**Learn From Your Fleet**
- 50 delivery robots improve navigation by sharing learnings
- Each robot keeps its data local (customer addresses, routes stay private)
- Models get better across the entire fleet

**Privacy-Compliant Training**
- Healthcare devices learn from patient data without HIPAA violations
- Financial systems improve without exposing transaction details
- Industrial equipment shares insights without revealing proprietary processes

**Edge AI That Gets Smarter**
- Robots learn collaboratively even in air-gapped environments
- No cloud required—peer-to-peer learning
- Works offline with periodic synchronization

---

## How It Works (Simple Version)

1. **Each device trains locally** on its own data
2. **Devices share only model updates** (not raw data)
3. **Updates are combined** using privacy-preserving techniques
4. **Improved model goes back** to all devices

Your data never leaves your device. Only encrypted mathematical updates are shared.

## Quick Start

```json5
{
  federated: {
    enabled: true,
    min_participants: 3,  // Need at least 3 devices
    enable_differential_privacy: true  // Extra privacy protection
  }
}
```

Now your devices can learn together while keeping data private.

## Real-World Use Cases

**Retail Robotics**
- 100 store robots learn optimal shelf restocking patterns
- Customer behavior insights stay in each store
- Chain-wide improvements without centralized data collection

**Healthcare Edge AI**
- Medical devices improve diagnostics from multiple hospitals
- Patient data never leaves the hospital
- HIPAA-compliant collaborative learning

**Manufacturing Quality Control**
- Inspection systems across factories share defect detection improvements
- Proprietary manufacturing data stays local
- Better AI without industrial espionage risks

---

## Why Use Federated Learning?

**Privacy by Design**
Your data never leaves your control. Only encrypted model updates are shared.

**Regulatory Compliance**
Meet GDPR, HIPAA, and data sovereignty requirements automatically.

**Better AI Faster**
Learn from 100 devices' experience instead of just one.

**Works Anywhere**
No cloud required. Devices can learn together on local networks or air-gapped environments.
