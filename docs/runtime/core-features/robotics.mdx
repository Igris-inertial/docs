## What You Can Build

**Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs)**
- Warehouse robots that navigate and respond to voice commands
- Delivery robots that understand natural language instructions
- Inspection robots with AI-powered visual analysis

**Industrial Automation**
- Manufacturing equipment with conversational interfaces
- Quality control systems with AI decision-making
- Predictive maintenance with human-in-the-loop approval

**Multi-Robot Systems**
- Coordinated robot fleets with shared AI knowledge
- Distributed task allocation with consensus voting
- Centralized monitoring of edge AI deployments

## Key Features

### ROS2 Integration

Connect your AI to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) ecosystem.

**What you get:**
- Send navigation goals to robots via AI commands
- Receive sensor data and robot status in real-time
- Coordinate multiple robots in the same system

**Example use case:**
"Navigate to the loading dock" → AI converts to ROS2 navigation goal → Robot executes autonomously

### Sensor & Actuator Control

Let your AI interact with the physical world.

**Supported hardware:**
- Cameras (USB/CSI) for visual input
- LIDAR for environment mapping
- GPIO pins for custom sensors and actuators

**Example use case:**
AI analyzes camera feed → Detects anomaly → Triggers alert via GPIO

### Safety & Compliance

Deploy AI in safety-critical environments with confidence.

**Built-in safety features:**
- Watchdog timers that trigger fail-safe modes
- Audit logging for regulatory compliance (ISO 26262, IEC 61508)
- Emergency stop capabilities
- Health monitoring and diagnostics

**Example use case:**
AI loses connectivity → Watchdog triggers → Robot enters fail-safe mode automatically

### Fleet Management

Monitor and control hundreds of edge AI devices from one place.

**Centralized control:**
- Register devices automatically
- Push configuration updates fleet-wide
- Collect telemetry in real-time
- Monitor health and performance

**Example use case:**
Deploy new AI model to 50 warehouse robots simultaneously from central dashboard

## Quick Start

### Enable ROS2 Integration

```json5
{
  ros2: {
    enabled: true,
    node_name: "igris_runtime_node",
    enable_nav2: true
  }
}
```

Now your AI can send navigation commands to ROS2-enabled robots.

### Enable Safety Features

```json5
{
  safety: {
    enabled: true,
    watchdog_timeout_secs: 5,
    auto_failsafe: true,
    enable_audit_log: true
  }
}
```

Your AI now has built-in safety monitoring and compliance logging.

### Connect to Fleet Manager

```json5
{
  fleet: {
    enabled: true,
    overture_endpoint: "https://your-fleet.example.com",
    agent_id: "robot-warehouse-01"
  }
}
```

Your device now reports to central fleet management.

## Real-World Examples

### Warehouse Automation

Deploy AI on autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for warehouse operations:

- Voice-controlled navigation: "Move to aisle 5, shelf B"
- Visual inspection: "Check if the pallet is properly stacked"
- Multi-robot coordination: AI assigns tasks across fleet
- Safety compliance: Automatic fail-safe when humans detected

### Agricultural Robotics

AI-powered farm equipment with edge processing:

- Crop health monitoring via camera analysis
- Autonomous navigation between fields
- Privacy-preserving data: Training happens on-device
- Works offline in remote locations

### Industrial Quality Control

AI inspection systems in manufacturing:

- Visual defect detection with cameras
- Human approval for critical decisions
- Audit trail for compliance
- Fleet-wide model updates

## Why Use Runtime for Robotics?

**Works Offline**
Robots often operate in areas with poor connectivity. Runtime works 100% offline.

**Safety First**
Built-in watchdog timers, fail-safe modes, and compliance logging for industrial use.

**Edge Processing**
All AI happens on the robot—no cloud latency, no privacy concerns.

**ROS2 Compatible**
Integrates seamlessly with existing ROS2 robotics infrastructure.

**Fleet Scale**
Manage thousands of robots from a central control plane.
